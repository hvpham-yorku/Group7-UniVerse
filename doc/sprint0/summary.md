**UniVerse - Connecting University students together!**

**Project Objective:** UniVerse is a social platform tailored for university students and uniquely designed to foster meaningful friendships and connections not only through ones academic field, but curated from shared interests. The objective is to provide students with an accessible platform to expand their social circles within their campus community, differentiating from the traditional social media route and tailored to the specific social needs of university life. 

**Key Personas:**
**Alex Martinez** - 25 year old, Graduate in Computer Science, also a Teaching Assistant
Alex lives off-campus, balancing coursework, research, and teaching responsibilities, leaving little time for socialising. His routine involves early mornings preparing for his TA sessions, afternoon lab work, and late evenings reviewing his research or studying. He finds that his social circle is limited to his department and misses the casual yet intellectually stimulating conversations from his undergrad years.
**Needs:** Alex is looking to expand his network by meeting people both inside and outside his field. He's especially interested in meeting students who enjoy coding, data science, and perhaps gaming or outdoor activities, as he finds these interests are not often shared within his academic circle.The highly focused nature of grad school can make him feel siloed. While professional networking platforms exist, they don't provide the kind of relaxed, social space he's hoping for on campus.
He sees UniVerse as a way to foster a better balance between his academic and social life, especially with people who understand the demands of graduate studies. He values intellectual exchange but also wants connections that can evolve into real friendships.

**Priya Patel** - 20 years old, Junior in Psychology, actively involved in campus clubs and organization
**Needs:** While she has an active social life, Priya is interested in branching out from her existing circle. She wants to meet people with niche interests, especially those she might not encounter through her regular extracurriculars, like students involved in the arts or activism.
Priya sometimes feels constrained by her current friend group, which can feel repetitive. She's also wary of mainstream social media, which she feels doesn't foster the same depth of connection she seeks.
Priya values diverse perspectives and wants connections that feel authentic and personal. She hopes UniVerse will help her find others with similar values, especially those involved in activism, psychology, or event planning.

**Key Scenarios:** 
1. **Profile Personalization & Setup**
Emma Martin, a first-year biology major, opens UniVerse for the first time. She creates a password-protected account with her email attached for authentication, chooses a unique username that well represents herself and personality, then uploads her profile picture. Emma sees the "Date Created" and "Last Active" status, which will help her track her activity. She sees the option to update her profile picture and username and knows she can delete her account anytime she wishes. Emma feels safe using UniVerse.

2. **Interest-based Matching Connection**
Matteo, a graduate Software Engineering student is loooking to connect with others who share his passion for creating mobile applications. After setting up his profile, Matteo receives suggestions to connect with other students who have similar interests and hobbies. He views profiles of peers interested in tech projects, which helps him find a new member to add to his development club!

3. **Messaging & Communication**
Amara and Jade are both art majors, who matched over their shared interest in abstract art. They agree to connect, which opens up UniVerse's secure messaging feature. Their chat history is saved, allowing them to plan meet-ups and share their opinions on various paintings. Amara appreciates the idea of knowing only agreed connections are able to message her. 

4. **Notifications & Filters**
Connor, a busy nursing student, customizes his notification settings. He chooses to recieve notifications only for new matches and messages, in order to avoid interruptions during study hours. Connor stays up-to-date with important connections while keeping control over his engagement levels while using UniVerse.
