## **Overview**  
This document provides an overview of our team’s collaborative process for developing a software project using Scrum methodology and Trello as our project management tool. It covers the organization of team roles, tools used for communication and task tracking, our decision-making methods, and strategies for prioritizing work.

Additionally, this document reflects on our approach to meetings, code reviews, and response times, outlining areas that worked well and lessons we aim to take forward for future phases of the project. This overview serves as both a record of our current practices and a roadmap for continuous improvement in our team dynamics and workflow.

## **Team Organization and Tools Used**

- **Communication Tools**: The team primarily uses the UniVerse Discord server for ongoing communication, planning, and updates. iMessage serves as a backup communication tool for urgent matters or connectivity issues.
- **Project Management and Project Tools**: Trello organizes our Scrum process, with lists for each stage (e.g., Product Backlog, Sprint-specific list, In Progress, Testing, and Completed). Each task card includes detailed descriptions (in some cases), priority status, effort needed, and labels to keep track of progress.
- **Version Control**: Each team member works on their own Git branch, and a “spin the wheel” tool assigns two random members to review code before a pull request to the main branch can be accepted and merged.

## **Decision-Making Process**

- **Collaborative Brainstorming**: Decisions are made through a collaborative process that begins with a brainstorming session, allowing team members to share ideas and solutions freely.
- **Voting for Consensus**: Following the brainstorming, decisions are made by voting to reach a consensus. This approach ensures that every member’s perspective is considered.

## **Defining Priorities and Point Estimates for User Stories**

- **Sprint Planning**: Each user story is assigned priority and point estimates during Sprint Planning. The team discusses each story's complexity, impact, and urgency before agreeing on priority levels.
- **Point Estimation**: To determine point estimates, team members propose initial estimates, and we use a voting process to finalize the point value. Typically, one or two rounds of voting bring us to a consensus on each estimate.

## **Meeting Frequency, Attendance, and Structure**

- **Stand-up Meetings**: Held 1-2 times weekly (a second meeting if needed), stand-ups are mandatory for all team members to ensure alignment on planning, task updates, and processes. Meeting dates are set up in advance and finalized in the Discord server.
- **Optional Meetings**: For specific tasks requiring only part of the team, additional meetings are optional and focused on resolving specific issues or setting up features.
- **Meeting Conduct**: Meetings are conducted online via Discord, with rotating note-taking responsibilities to ensure all members contribute to documentation. Team members are encouraged to share updates and ideas in a positive, open environment.
- **Meeting Preparation**: Each member prepares an update on their assigned task for each stand-up to communicate their progress effectively.

## **Lessons Learned for the Next Phase**

- **Communication Consistency**: Maintaining consistent response times (ideally within a day) proves essential for smooth coordination and planning. This standard will remain a priority in future sprints.
- **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Voting after brainstorming fosters a sense of inclusivity and balanced input, which we’ll continue to implement.
- **Clearer Backlog Prioritization**: We’ve learned that defining clearer priorities early on for tasks in Trello improves our focus and sprint efficiency.
- **Effective Code Review Process**: Using “spin the wheel” for random code reviews added variety and fairness, encouraging all team members to stay engaged in the review process.
