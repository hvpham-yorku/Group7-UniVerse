# Overview:

We also talk about how our app/solution is different from our competitors, and how it is also better. 


# Competitors

    - Discord was originally for gamers but has evolved into a space where communities gather based on a variety of interests.

3. Facebook Groups

4. Reddit Communities
    - https://www.reddit.com/
    - Reddit has multiple subreddits which are essentially multiple communities based on topic and interests.

## What makes us different?
**UniVerse** is different because:
1. Focus on 1-1 connections:
    Unlike Facebook, Discord, and Reddit which focus on community engagements, we would be focusing on 1-1 connections. This allows users to find specific people to connext with, based on mutual interest, therefore eliminating the need to join larger groups which would be intimidating to some.

2. Refined Interst Matching for Niche Hobbies:
    Discord and Reddit offer large communities for a wide range of topics, but finding individuals with shared niche interests can be challenging in large groups. Our app allows users to specify unique hobbies and filters that streamline the process of connecting with people who have very specific interests.

3. Simplified Messaging
    Messaging on platforms like Reddit and Discord can often feel cluttered , especially in communities that are active. Our app offers a focused and streamlines messaging experience designed for straightforward conversation without the distracton of a larger community.
