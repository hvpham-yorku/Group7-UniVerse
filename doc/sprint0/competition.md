# Overview:

This document shows existing applications that offer some type of friend matching or social network based on shared interest among eachother. 

We also talk about how our app/solution is different from our competitors, and how it is also better. 


# Competitors
1. ## Bumble BFF
    - https://bumble.com/en-us/bff
    - Bumble is a dating app, but then had an extension to it called Bumble BFF which is an extension of it, that focuses on helping people make new friends. 

2. Discord
    - https://discord.com/
    - Discord was originally for gamers but has evolved into a space where communities gather based on a variety of interests.

3. Facebook Groups
    - https://www.facebook.com/groups/feed/
    - Facebook group allows user to join communities based on shared intersts. They can interact, share posts and attend events.

4. Reddit Communities
    - https://www.reddit.com/
    - Reddit has multiple subreddits which are essentially multiple communities based on topic and interests.

## What makes us different?
**UniVerse** is different because:
1. Focus on 1-1 connections:
    Unlike Facebook, Discord, and Reddit which focus on community engagements, we would be focusing on 1-1 connections. This allows users to find specific people to connext with, based on mutual interest, therefore eliminating the need to join larger groups which would be intimidating to some.

2. Refined Interst Matching for Niche Hobbies:
    Discord and Reddit offer large communities for a wide range of topics, but finding individuals with shared niche interests can be challenging in large groups. Our app allows users to specify unique hobbies and filters that streamline the process of connecting with people who have very specific interests.

3. Simplified Messaging
    Messaging on platforms like Reddit and Discord can often feel cluttered , especially in communities that are active. Our app offers a focused and streamlines messaging experience designed for straightforward conversation without the distracton of a larger community. 

4. Tailored Activity Planning:
    Although Bumble BFF and Facebook Groups help people connect, they lack built-in tools for activity planning. Our app offers integrated features that allow users to organize and schedule activities, such as meetups or shared hobby sessions, directly within the platform.

## Target Users and Scenarios
- **Primary Users**: Our ideal users are individuals who are passionate about specific hobbies or interests and seek meaningful one-on-one connections, rather than joining larger, generalized communities. They prefer a personalized and focused platform to find more like-mdined people. 

### Key Scenarios:
    - University students who are new to campus or looking to expand their social circles beyond academic settings. They may be interested in connecting with others for study groups, club activities and many other things.
    - Users who want a straightforward way to meet others with shared interests, without navigating through large online communities.
    - People moving to a new city looking to make friends with specific hobbies, such as photography, language exchange, or hiking.
    - Users looking for activity partners for regular sessions, like weekly book clubs, game nights, or fitness meetups/workout partners.

## Why Competitors May Not Focus on These Users and Scenarios
1. Community-Based Focus:
    Facebook Groups, Reddit, and Discord are mostly set up to build big communities around common interests. They’re great for group discussions, but they don’t really help if you’re just looking to meet one person with a specific shared hobby. It’s harder for users to make individual connections in these large groups.
2. General Friend-Finding:
    Bumble BFF does a decent job helping people find friends based on location and some common interests, but it doesn’t really support planning specific activities together. Adding features to help users actually meet up and do things would be a big change to how their app currently works.
3. Too Much Noise:
    Reddit and Discord have so many different conversations happening at once, which can be distracting. For someone trying to find a specific friend with a particular interest, it’s easy to get lost in all the unrelated content. Our app removes those distractions and keeps the focus on connecting one-on-one with people who share your interests.

## What It Would Take for Competitors to Focus on These Users and Scenarios
1. Personalized Matching for Niche Interests:
    Platforms like Facebook and Bumble BFF would need to create more personalized matching systems to help people connect over specific, niche interests, not just general categories. This would mean developing better filters so users can find others with very particular hobbies or passions. They’d also have to rethink their user experience to make one-on-one connections feel natural and engaging.

2. Adding Activity Planning Tools:
    To match our app’s focus on activity planning, competitors would need to build features like in-app calendars or event scheduling. This would be a big change for platforms like Bumble BFF, which is mainly about making initial connections, not organizing meetups. They’d also need a simple way for users to set up and manage plans with each other, which could complicate their current design.

3. Shifting from Community Focus to Direct Connections:
    For social apps like Discord and Reddit, which are all about community interactions, switching to direct friend-matching would require major changes. They’d need to create dedicated spaces or tools for one-on-one connections, which would be a big shift from their group-focused setup. This would mean cutting down on the usual "noise" of large communities to help people find and connect with each other directly.
