## 3. Practices for the Next Sprint
### Practices to Continue:
- On average, good response time from team members.  
- Good code review process.  
- Amazing collaboration.  
- Great communication between team members.  
- Trello board and product backlog is always organized and clear.  
- Ensuring tasks/user stories are worked on in a timely manner.  
- Sharing troubleshooting tips that might help others in the team.  

### New Practices to Try:
- Implementing some pair programming sessions (2 or more people).  
- Planning meeting agendas beforehand to stick to our time limit.  
- Making our commit messages clearer for pull request reviewers (e.g., ensuring clarity on which commit needs to be reviewed and what was done/what has changed).  
- Providing more detailed feedback/comments regarding changes on GitHub.  

### Harmful Practices to Stop:
- Having no strict deadlines to follow for completing user stories.  
- Rushing `.md` files and other documentation toward the deadline (although we don’t really do this, lol).

## 4. Reflections on Sprint 1
### Best Experience:
- **Timi:** Seeing a “fully” functioning messaging platform.  
- **Kosy:** Having tasks delegated to each team member and everyone working together to make a functional application. Also, designing and coding the UI from Window Builder (JFrame) to make sure it looks very similar to our Figma design.  
- **Kennie:** Learning more about Firebase/other frameworks we used and syncing it to our actual application. The overall process of creating the application + the documentation process! :)  
- **Elyse:** Being able to get the Firebase database to store messages correctly with minimal troubleshooting! Also, seeing our application evolve from a theoretical idea into an actual desktop application that is functional—especially in the beginning with a great team.  

### Worst Experience:
- **Timi:** Having to write code for the UI.  
- **Kosy:** Briefly struggling with using Firebase (database). Also, encountering errors in Eclipse, not knowing where the problem was, and trying to debug the issue.  
- **Elyse:** Troubleshooting with Eclipse, but thanks to great guidance from my team members, it was sorted quicker than expected!
