### 1. What did you work on since the last standup?
- Timi: I finished adding the restriction that users can only create accounts if they complete their profile, and I also added the ability to save profile images.

- Sarimah: Reviewed the notification system and started writing test cases for it.

### 2. What do you commit to next?
- Timi: I’ll finish up ChatGPT integration and start testing the messaging feature.
- Elyse: I’m going to finalize the notifications system and fix any small bugs that pop up. Plus, attempting a new feature in notifications to add a pop-up profile.
- Kosy: Wrap up the “Join Community” functionality on the Groups page and make it connected to the database (Firestore).
- Kennie: Review the Groups page design features (create group, join group, delete group, view group) with the team and make any final updates and make it connected to the database (Firestore).

### 4. Do you have any blockers?

- Kennie: Waiting on feedback from Kosy and others for the final design.
- Sarimah: Some features aren’t ready for testing yet, which slows me down.
