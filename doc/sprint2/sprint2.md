**Decision Making**
1. Workflow: For workflow purposes our team decided it would be best to work in pairs for specific branches - one for each feature (Notifications, Community, User Profile Management & AI Chatbot). Both notification and community would be split and allow for 2 people to work each page, jumping in when necessary. For AI Chatbot and User Profile was assigned to one person to carry out the designated group and if issues arise, the rest of the team would jump in. Each person would let other members know what they are working on and when they are done/need help and another person would continue the work done on the branch. Meaning that each person only commited their changes. Final PR made at the end with 2 people to review.

2. All of the above was decided together with the group to ensure all members were on the same page and agreed.
